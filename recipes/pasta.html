    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>So, you're standing in the grocery store looking at an endless display of pasta noodles and you ask yourself, "How do you cook pasta?" The good news is, it's not hard. In fact, it's one of the easiest bits of cooking you can do. Still, there are a few simple tricks to master so your pasta turns out just right. We'll show you how to cook pasta, including how long to cook pasta, and answer some frequently asked questions about how to cook pasta noodles.  </p>
   
    <ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>1 pound uncooked pasta</li>
    <li> A colander for draining the pasta</li>
    <li>1-2 tablespoons of salt</li>
    <li>Four to six quarts of cold water</li> 
    <li>A long-handled heat-proof spoon</li>

     </ul>
     
     <ol>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
     <li><P> Bring the water to a full, rolling boil. Before adding the pasta, add salt to the boiling water. If you don't season the cooking water, the pasta may taste flat â€” no matter how salty the sauce may be. The temperature of the water will drop once you add the pasta, so make sure the water's at a full boil before adding the pasta noodles.</P>
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong> Be careful when you add the pasta to your boiling water; sometimes, the water can splash up and you don't want to burn your hands.</p></li>

     <li> Stir gently.</li>
     <li>Cook your pasta at a rapid boil until it's tender but slightly firm to the bite.</li>
     <li> Drain the pasta in a colander.</li> 
     <li>
        <p>Serve pasta immediately.</p>
        <em>We highly recommend using warm bowls!</em>
