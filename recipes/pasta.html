    <ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <li>1 pound uncooked pasta</li>
    <li> A colander for draining the pasta</li>
    <li>1-2 tablespoons of salt</li>
    <div><li>Four to six quarts of cold water</li> </div>
    <li>A long-handled heat-proof spoon</li>

     </ul>
     
     <ol>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
     <li><P> Bring the water to a full, rolling boil. Before adding the pasta, add salt to the boiling water. If you don't season the cooking water, the pasta may taste flat â€” no matter how salty the sauce may be. The temperature of the water will drop once you add the pasta, so make sure the water's at a full boil before adding the pasta noodles.</P>
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong> Be careful when you add the pasta to your boiling water; sometimes, the water can splash up and you don't want to burn your hands.</p></li>

     <li> Stir gently.</li>
     <li>Cook your pasta at a rapid boil until it's tender but slightly firm to the bite.</li>
     <li> Drain the pasta in a colander.</li> 
     <li>
        <p>Serve pasta immediately.</p>
        <em>We highly recommend eating it when its <strong>HOT!!!</strong></em>
